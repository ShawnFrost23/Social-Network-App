## How to Run
To work with your frontend code locally with the web server, you will have to run another web server to serve the frontend. To do this, in the project folder you can run:

`$ python3 -m http.server`

This will start up a second HTTP server where if you navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever URL it provides) it will run your `index.html`

Go into Backend folder and run:
`$ python3 run.py`

This is to start the backend server
